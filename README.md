# Pediatric Dentistry Poem

Little Smiles, Big Dreams
-----------------------

Tiny teeth like pearls so white,
Need gentle care to shine just right.
In our office filled with joy,
Every girl and every boy
Learns that dentists are their friends,
Where fear begins is where it ends.

Brushing, flossing, every day,
Makes the cavity bugs go away.
Fluoride shields like armor bright,
Keeps those teeth strong day and night.
Gentle hands and patient hearts,
That's how dental wellness starts.

So bring your smile, don't be shy,
We'll make your dental visit fly!
With stickers, prizes, and lots of fun,
You'll be sad when we are done.
Remember friends, both young and small,
Healthy smiles are best of all!
